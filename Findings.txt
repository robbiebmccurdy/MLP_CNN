		Seems to be a toss-up on whether or not the model can determine things overall. However, upon individual inspection, it seems as though we are
		doing fairly well with finding cars, planes, and ships. The reverse of this though, we are doing extremely poor finding cats and birds. Ideally
		we'd like these numbers to be close to 70% but that may be too optimistic for this model/project. So we will shoot for hopefully an overall
		network accuracy of ~60%.

		In the MLP model for the CIFAR-10 dataset, incorporating a validation step significantly enhances training effectiveness. Through regular validation checks after each training epoch, I can pinpoint the ideal moment to halt training, helping to prevent overfitting. This is evident when the model performs increasingly well on training data but starts faltering on validation data.

		Moreover, validation insights are key in fine-tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the model's architecture. If the model underperforms on the validation set, it suggests a need for modificationsâ€”perhaps a more complex structure or extended training. Conversely, a pronounced gap between training and validation performance could indicate overfitting, necessitating the introduction of regularization methods. Ultimately, this approach ensures the model's robust generalization, preparing it for effective real-world application.
